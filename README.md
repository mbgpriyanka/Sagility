# Introduction 
This fast api application can be used to query a set of text files and retrieve information from it in a chat.

# Build and Test
Install using the requirements.txt file
Please replace the openai api key with a relevant one(the one mentioned does not run because of rate limit). I used 
Postman to send request with a post method and body -
{
   "user_input": "hi"
}
